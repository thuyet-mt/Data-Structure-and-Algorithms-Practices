# Data Structure and Algorithms Practices

I completed this project during my academic coursework in 'Data Structures and Algorithms.' The project involved implementing fundamental data structures such as Array, Linked List, Queue, Stack, Tree, Graph, Heap, and sorting algorithms including Bubble, Merge, Quick, Selection, Insertion, and Heap. This project was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of basic data structures in programming, and I look forward to applying this knowledge to real-world projects in the future.
